A CLI Application for downloading posts from the Internet to EPUB or Markdown format.

Inspired by [lapwat/papeer](), which is written in Go (I've used `papeer` for so long and it's great. There are some drawbacks when it comes to downloading multiple posts so I decided to rewrite the application in Rust).
